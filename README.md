## NWTOPT
#### by Max Newcomer (2021)

NWTOPT is a Linux based, hyperparameter optimization and tuning system for steady-state and transient models ran by MODFLOW-NWT. NWTOPT is a distributed, parallel compute, and MODFLOW-NWT specific extension of the hyperparameter optimization [Hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt) framework. While you can run NWTOPT on any system of Linux computers, NWTOPT also comes with specific support for [HTCondor](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/), a High Throughput Computing system for large collections of distributively owned computing resources.
